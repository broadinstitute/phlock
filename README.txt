Flock is a lightweight library for managing scatter/gather jobs run on a job
scheduler such as SGE or LSF.

More specifically, in this library can be used to execute an R script on a vector or list of inputs, potentially submitting them to a queuing system where they'll execute asynchronously, and then 
aggregate all of the results with a second R script.

See the README.md for more information.
